This project provides a comprehensive analysis of website engagement data to assess the effectiveness of various digital marketing channels. The objective is to identify performance gaps, optimize underperforming sources, and support data-driven decisions in digital strategy.

Key Research Questions Addressed:
1. How does user engagement vary across different default channel groups?

2. Which channels exhibit the highest and lowest average engagement time per session?

4. Do some channels contribute disproportionately to total event count despite fewer sessions?

5. Is there a correlation between engagement rate and number of sessions?

6. Which channels consistently underperform or outperform across multiple metrics?

Key Insight (Graph Included):
The report includes one primary graph comparing average engagement time per session across channel groups, identifying Email and Organic Search as top performers, while Paid Search and Social show potential for improvement.
